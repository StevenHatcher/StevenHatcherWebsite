                    sports, technology, and taking things apart to learn how they work (sorry mom).<br>
                     I am currently finishing my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science at the University of Regina (Fall 2025)! If you've found this page, I'd be an excellent candidate to hire!<br><br>
                     I like to maintain a balance between staying active and enjoying the quieter times in life!

                    and creating software. I love combining the two so I can bring my ideas to life. If you want to learn more about what I've made, take a look at my portfolio and my Github!

                        I started playing rugby in 2024 and can't even begin to tell you how life-changing it has been. I signed on with no prior contact-sport experience and while it took me some time to find my footing,
                        I got it eventually thanks the undying support of my teammates. In what was originally just a way to get some cardio back into my routine following the pandemic, I 
                        ended up meeting the most passionate and supportive people I have ever met, and found myself growing as a person more than as an athlete.<br><br>
                        Join the team! We're always happy to have new players join the team and help expand the sport within the city!

                            I'm a connoisseur of all sorts of video games! Metroidvania, sandbox, FPS, count me in! I'm a fan of many indie games like Terraria, The Messenger (I can't recommend this game enough), Castle Crashers, Katana Zero, etc.
                            There are so many AAA games that I enjoy as well!<br>
                            I recently built a new pc and get to experience the joy of raytracing and pathtracing in all their glory now!
